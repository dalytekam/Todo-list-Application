# Todo-list-Application

This App can register the task, mark them as done, delete them. There is also a dynamic filter system. I use the Front End Framework

Bootstrap to make the responsive layout. The state of the task is saved in the local storage as well to persist the Datas.

The App can be tried here [To do List Application](https://dalytekam.github.io/Todo-list-Application/)

Technologies used: 

**HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript/ES6**, **Bootstrap**.
